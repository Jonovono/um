Command: `MERGE`

    Will essentially rename all the tags after the first listed
    tag into the first one. So all files tagged with ones tagged
    from the 'from tags' will now be tagged with the 'into tag'

Usage: um merge <into-tag> <from-tag> [from-more...] 


 Examples:
  um merge t1 t2 t3 t4   // This will rename t2,t3,t4 to t1.
